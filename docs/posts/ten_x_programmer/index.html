"><p>An esteemed colleague of mine were recently talking about the concept of the 10x programmer. This idea exists in the software development industry as a whisper of mythological personas. To those of you who have never heard of this cliche, 10x programmers are the demi-heroes of our industry: they get massive accomplishments done with seemingly supernatural endurance and passion.  Perhaps you think you are one ( or someone you know )? I challenge you with the question &ldquo;How would you know?&rdquo;. This term is popular enough that it deserves attention, and I think we can improve it from something vague into something concrete.</p>
<p>I will argue that understanding the term 10x programmer has many uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving the identification valuable team members with exceptional skills</li>
<li>identifying specific actions and skills one can acquire to become a 10x programmer</li>
<li>dispelling useless ideas that distract the analysis of your team&rsquo;s clusters of talent</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="genus">Genus</h2>
<p>To improve this word what i&rsquo;m going to do is attempt to give it a more solid definition that is logically consistent with the observed knowledge I have as a seasoned programmer.  How should we do this? A useful definition should follow aristotelian structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give the word (term)</li>
<li>Identify the group which the term belongs to (genus)</li>
<li>Identify the essential differing properties from the group the term belongs to (differentia)</li>
</ol>
<p>This first leads us to the question, &ldquo;what group is a 10x programmer in relation to?&rdquo;.  There are many options:</p>
<ul>
<li>the worst programmers in existence amongst all programmers</li>
<li>the average programmers in existence amongst all programmers</li>
<li>entry level programmers amongst an organization</li>
</ul>
<p>When talking about comparison of individuals it&rsquo;s important to try to remove as many non essential variables as possible. It&rsquo;s useless to compare 10x programmers totally outside of a specific context. Consider for instance the choice of looking at 10x programmers at my organization as a context.  This choice allows us to completely eliminate many categories of programmers from consideration with non-essential attributes outside of my organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>programmers still in school and not even working at my organization</li>
<li>retired programmers not working in any organization</li>
<li>programmers in entirely different industries or skill sets outside of my organization&rsquo;s domain of work</li>
</ul>
<p>The choice of defining 10x programmers within the context of an organization may seem an easy obvious choice, but let me demonstrate some examples that show its lack of utility.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Within organization ABC there is an exceptionally talented programmer.  All programmers at this organization are similarly skilled and there are no junior programmers.  10x programmers don&rsquo;t exist in this world despite there being objectively great programmers.  This choice of context has prevented us from distinguishing how good the individual is at our organization actually are due to no contrast in relativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within organization XYZ there is an average programmer, but every other developer at this company is completely unskilled.  Relatively, this person is a rockstar compared to their peers, a 10x only in the relation to bad programmers of this ill-fated company. This choice of context has prevented us from seeing the true averageness of the individual and the dire situation of the organization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>10x programmer as a concept cannot be useful when it&rsquo;s constrained by an organizational context due to organizations having the potential to be greatly imbalanced (and often are over time). Remember, we&rsquo;re trying to identify the truly exceptional! Let&rsquo;s consider an alternative choice of context to constrain our relations using a programmers role.  This feels appropriate at first glance due to our knowledge that not every programmer is an alternative for another, consider various roles that have individuals who are primarily compared between each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>graphics</em> programmers are compared to other graphics programmers</li>
<li><em>intern</em> programmers are compared to other interns</li>
<li><em>web</em> programmers are compared to other web devs</li>
<li><em>senior</em> programmers are compared to other senior devs</li>
</ul>
<p>By using the context of a programmer&rsquo;s role as the genus we discover major insight.  By allowing us to declare &ldquo;This programmer in this role is 10x better than their peers of similar role&rdquo;, we have the ability to offer evidence to many more useful questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Do we have top tier talent for the roles of programmers we hire?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Are the interns we&rsquo;ve hired of high quality?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is our software engineer of such high performance they deserve a promotion to senior engineer?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the types of questions I believe the term 10x programmer was meant to be used for in an answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a 10x programmer, we should promote her above her peers&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our devops team is really average compared to the 10x devops I saw at my last company&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;That new intern is 10x and hungry, I can see them going places fast&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to identify those who are exceptional in our industry at many skills capacities (junior, senior, etc.) and within comparable types of work (web programming, game programming, devops).</p>
<h2 id="differentia">Differentia</h2>
<p>This brings us to our next question, in what objective ways is a 10x programmer measurably different from their peers? Let&rsquo;s start first with eliminating possibilities.</p>
<p>Firstly our differentia must be something of a long-standing quality.  When talking about the essentials of anything, we must describe the aspects that primarily account for the overall entity.  Random strikes of inspiration, luck, knowing one particular thing at the right moment but nothing else the rest of the time should be totally eliminated.  We&rsquo;re talking about objective qualities of a programmer that are long standing aspects of who they are.</p>
<p>Even within these essential traits that are long-standing there are many ways in which a programmer can never be an order of magnitude greater than their peers:</p>
<p>Consider first typing speed.  A 10x programmer will never be differentiated by natural typing speed.  There are physical and cognitive limits to a programmer&rsquo;s ability to type out code. Even if it were possible to augment with technology the speed of typing at 10x ( perhaps through the use of AI or autocompletion ), it is a useless metric that has nothing to do with code quality, if a quick typer types and deletes bad code multiple times their speed does nothing for them versus a programmer that writes the correct code the first time.</p>
<p>Consider also lines of code.  A 10x programmer is not necessarily distinguished by lines of code.  10x quantities of inappropriate abstractions for a simple requirement is not an advantage.  When we try to distinguish a programmer from their peers, meaningful lines of code that satisfy the user and reduce maintenance costs should be what is of consideration.</p>
<p>Consider other physical limits: such a cognitive memory space (how many things can one keep in their mind at once), multi-tasking, conscious hours in a day, speaking time with other individuals.  These are dimensions which programmers can certainly have advantages in, but not 10x order of magnitude advantages.</p>
<p>Viable candidates for differentia concentrate on long-term mental/personal characteristics of the programmer&rsquo;s consciousness itself.  Not all long term mental capacities a programmer might be 10x capable of are useful to the domain of programming.  Consider recalling random facts (such as flags of a country).  Not quite useful for the writing of code.  Consider one&rsquo;s love of cooking? A person might have a great hobby (say cooking), but if that passion is isolated to a personal pursuit independent of programming, it&rsquo;s useless to our definition.</p>
<p>The characteristics I will argue that are essential to the 10x programmers are the habits that specifically maximize utilization of a programmer&rsquo;s physical time to create product features.</p>
<h2 id="high-output-habits-of-10x-programmers">High-output habits of 10x Programmers</h2>
<p>To show my induction of my conclusion, I will make the argument that creating meaningful and appropriately architected product features has objective requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>time to do the work</li>
<li>a desire to do the work and learn</li>
<li>clear understanding of what&rsquo;s valuable to a customer to make that time worthwhile</li>
<li>working knowledge of one&rsquo;s code base</li>
</ul>
<p>A 10x programmer excels in all of these requirements to various high degrees allowing them to outpace their peers.  The biggest constraint is primarily time.  Time can be used well or time can be wasted.  It&rsquo;s the mental capacities and personality of the programmer that make that time well spent or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a desire to do the work</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A 10x programmer doesn&rsquo;t just view their job as a boring means to pay the bills.  To them programming is their life pursuit, a passion that does not stop at the end of a day.  They love to learn, to produce, and will do so even when not being paid or told to do so.  They have made programming their purpose and that gives them the endurance to make things by utilizing their time for longer periods of time than their peers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>clear understanding of what&rsquo;s valuable to a customer to make that time worthwhile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10x programmers don&rsquo;t view their work in a vacuum.  Their work serves a well defined purpose, and they apply reasoning of their work towards that purpose.  Reasoning of the customers&rsquo; needs or internal engineering&rsquo;s needs prevents them ultimately from using their time in poor ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>working knowledge of one&rsquo;s code base</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They know the terrain of their code.  There is a huge difference from a programmer day 1 of joining a company and 6 months in.  They have not put the blinders on about any dark corners of their code repo.  They seek new ways to unblock themselves to allow their use of time to never be hindered.</p>
<p>There are also two other habits of <em>programmers qua programmers</em> that are independent of product feature requirements, but also have great impact on use of time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a strategic method of building knowledge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are always looking out for new useful principles to integrate their experience.  To a 10x programmer, the world of programming is not a world of totally unique snowflakes.  There are patterns all over one can recognize, and form into a useful principle for use the next time the situation is encountered.  10x programmers actively build these principles from their own experience and when principles are borrowed from authorities they are validated personally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>they automate</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoiding expensive work twice, once knowledge has been acquired, programmers are in a unique position to automate what they learned.  10x programmers take advantage of this to save themselves from redundant expenditure of time.</p>
<p>Looking at this list we see similarities amongst these traits that they are all mental advantages.  Importantly, there are advantages with a huge spread of impact enough to contribute to the order of magnitude of &ldquo;10x&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>the difference between the endurance of a programmer who loves their job vs hates it is huge</li>
<li>the difference between a programmer who automates and one who doesn&rsquo;t is huge</li>
<li>the difference between a programmer who knows their code base and one who doesn&rsquo;t is huge</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the impacts of these habits are multiplied together to get time usage to that heroic tier.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion we&rsquo;ve identified a useful definition based on traits that create objectively-measurable high impact action for the creation of valueable product deliverables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>10x programmer</strong> <em>tɛn ɛks ˈprəʊgræmə</em> - n. A programmer of a specific role who has achieved a 10x utilization of their time compared to their peers of a similar role via the acquisition of long-term personal alignment with their work and effective knowledge building/application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this definition we can identify the exceptional members of our organization clearly. These marvelous people that enduringly accomplish great work can be taken down from a pedestal of mythological and seen as realistically heroic peers.  Their skills can inspire us with fuel to achieve our own greatness, and not live as a mystery lacking useful comparison or reflection.</p>
