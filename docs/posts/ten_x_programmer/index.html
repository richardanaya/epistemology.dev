"><p>An esteemed colleague of mine were talking recently about the concept of the 10x programmer.  In our industry of software development a certain whisper of these mythological personas has spread far enough that I think it deserves attention.  Understanding what makes a 10x programmer I think has many uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>improving the indentification valuable team members with exceptional skills</li>
<li>knowing concrete actions and reflection one can take to become a 10x programmer</li>
<li>dispelling useless ideas that prevent you from seeing your situation with clearer eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by talking definitions.  A 10x programmer should be categorically consistent with other terminology.  What is the genus what is the differentia.  The is an important place to begin because analysis of the genus first leads us to the question, &ldquo;what is a 10x programmer in reference to?&rdquo;.  There are many options:</p>
<ul>
<li>relative to the worst programmer in existence</li>
<li>relative to the average programmer in existence</li>
<li>relative to the worst programmer within an organization</li>
</ul>
<p>We come first to the realization that 10x programmer really is an assignment of skill relative to another group, definitionally I think we should consider the genus the organization to which the programmer belongs to.  When talking about comparison of skills I think it&rsquo;s important to try to isolate as many variables as possible.  Defining the genus of a 10x programmer as &ldquo;the organization the 10x programmer belongs to&rdquo; helps us filter out non-essential comparisons.  When we talk about 10x programmers we&rsquo;re not comparing a person to:</p>
<ul>
<li>programmers fresh out of school</li>
<li>programmers in entirely different industries or skill sets</li>
</ul>
<p>By constraining our contrast to the organization a programmer belongs to we can more narrowly focus on important distinguishing differentia.</p>
<p>This brings us to our next question, in what ways is a 10x programmer different from their peers? Let&rsquo;s start firstly with eliminating possibilities.  There are many ways in which a programmer can never be an order of magnitude greater than their peers.</p>
