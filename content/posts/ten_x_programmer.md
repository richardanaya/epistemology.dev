An esteemed colleague of mine were talking recently about the concept of the 10x programmer. They exist in the software development industry as a whisper of mythological personas. To those of you who have never heard of this cliche, 10x programmers are the demi-heroes of our industry.  They get massive accomplishments done with seemingly super-natural endurance and passion.  Perhaps you think you are one ( or someone you know )? I challenge you with the question "How would you know?". This cliche has gone far enough that I think it deserves attention, and I think we can improve this anticoncept into a real concept. 

I will argue that understanding what makes a so-called 10x programmer has many uses:

* improving the indentification valuable team members with exceptional skills
* identifying concrete actions and skills one can acquire to become a 10x programmer
* dispelling useless ideas that distract the analysis of your team's dimensions of talent

## Genus

To improve this word what i'm going to do is attempt to give it a more solid definition that matches the intent I understand of the word and is logically consistent with the knowledge I know as a seasoned programmer.  How should we do this? A useful definition should follow aristotlean structure:

1. Give the word (term)
2. Identify the group which the term belongs to (genus)
3. Identify the essential differing properties from the group the term belongs to (differentia)

This first leads us to the question, "what group is a 10x programmer in relation to?".  There are many options:

* the worst programmers in existence amongst all programmers
* the average programmers in existence amongst all programmers
* entry level programmers amongst an organization
* the opinion of what an average programmer is amonst all programmers 

We come first to the recognition that 10x programmer really is a person in a relationship based on skill relative to others within group.  I want to stress first that this relationship should ideally be objective ( existing in reality outside of the mind ) between programmers.  We're wanting to stay as far from a subjective definition as possible, as many people can have imaginations of what programmers are rockstars despite lack of evidence.  We're talking about real performance of some kind that's measurable in the same way that a marathon runner can be objectively measured vs another.

Secondly, we come to the recognition that we need to make a useful categorization. When talking about comparison of skills I think it's important to try to isolate as many non essential variables as possible.  Rarely are we trying to compare 10x programmers totally outside of a specific context. Consider for instance the choice of looking at 10x programmers at my organization.  This choice allows us to completely eliminate many dimensions of programmers from consideration

* programmers still in school
* retired programmers
* programmers in entirely different industries or skill sets outside of my organizations

The choice of definiting 10x programmers within the context of an organization may seem easy, but let me demonstrate some examples that show it's lack of utility.  

* One programmer works at a company with truly great programmers.  All programmers at this organization are similarly skilled and there are no junior programmers.  10x programmers don't exist in this world despite there being objectively great programmers.  This choice of context has prevented us from recognizing how good the individual is at our organization actually are due to no contrast in relativity.
* One programmer works at a company, they are average skilled, but every other developer at this company is completely miserable.  Relatively, this person is a rockstar compared to their peers, a 10x only in the relation to bad programmers of this ill-fated company. This choice of context has prevented us from seeing the true averageness of the individual.

10x programmer as a concept cannot be a relation within a organizational context as organizations can be greatly imbalanced. Let's consider an alternative choice of context to constrain our relations using a programmers *role*.  When assigning 10x status we demand a specific context of a role.

* 10x *graphics* programmer
* 10x *intern* programmer
* 10x *web* programmer
* 10x *principle* programmer

Only compared to the role of a programmer as the genus does the terminology become useful.  We suddenly have many more useful questions we can answer with such a constraint founded in evidence:

* do we have top tier talent for the roles of programmers we hire?
* are the interns we've hired of high quality?
* is our software engineer of such high performance they deserve a promotion?

These are the types of questions I believe the term 10x programmer was meant to answer.  We want to identify that which is exceptional in our industry at many skills levels and in the context of specific types of work.

 ## Differentia

This brings us to our next question, in what objective ways is a 10x programmer different from their peers? Let's start firstly with eliminating possibilities.  

Firstly our differentia must be something of a long-standing quality.  When talking about the essentials of anything, we must describe the aspects that primarily account for the overall entity.  Random strikes of inspiration, luck, knowing one particular thing at the right moment in time should be totally eliminated.  We're talking about objective qualities of a programmer that are long standing aspects of who they are.

Even within these essential traits there are many ways in which a programmer can never be an order of magnitude greater than their peers:

Consider first typing speed.  A 10x programmer can never be differentiated by natural typing speed.  There are physical and cognitive limits to a programmers ability to type out code. Even if it were possible to augment with technology the speed of typing at 10x ( perhaps through the use of AI or autocompletion ), it is a useless metric that has nothing to do with code quality, if a quick typer types and deletes bad code multiple times their speed does nothing for them versus a programmer that writes the correct code the first time.

Consider also lines of code.  A 10x programmer is not necessarily disinguished by lines of code.  10x quantities of inappropriate abstractions for a simple requirement is not an advantage.  When we tryin to distinguish a programmer from their peers, meaningful architected lines of code should be what is of consideration. 

Consider other physical limits: such a cognitive memory, concious hours in a day, caffiene intake, number of meetings with colleagues.  These are dimensions which programmers can certainly have advantages in, but not 10x order of magnitude advantages.  

The viable candidates remaining concentrate on long-term mental/personal characteristics of the programmer's conciousness itself.  When integrating various advantages we see programmers have, we begin to see the commonality of increasing the utilization of a programmers physical time.  The leads us to a conclusion that 10x programmer is sufficiently distinguished by objective cognitive qualities that allow the individual to maximize the utilization of their time in an enduring stating way.

## Objective cognitive qualities of 10x Programmers

Below are my personal inductions of habits that meet that criteria from my observed experiences of the greatest programmers i've worked with:

Knowing one's objective purpose and loving it deeply.
- not destructive habits irrationally aligned

Knowing one's codebase and processes broadly to be maximally autonomous

Forming knowledge well

## Conclusion

In conclusion we've identified a useful and objective definition of 10x programmer:

> A programmer of a specific role who has acheived a 10x utilization of their time compared to their peers of a similar role via the acquisition long-term deep personal alignment with their work and effective knowledge building of their role's field.

With this definition we can identify the exceptional members of our organization.  These marveled people that enduringly accomplish great work can be taken down from a pedestal of mythological and seen as realistically heroic peer they are.  Their skills can inspire us with fuel to acheive our own greatness, and not live as a mystery lacking useful comparison or reflection.
