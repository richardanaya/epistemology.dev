An esteemed colleague of mine were talking recently about the concept of the 10x programmer.  In our industry of software development a certain whisper of these mythological personas has spread far enough that I think it deserves attention. 10x programmers are the demi-heroes of our industry. Understanding what makes a 10x programmer I think has many uses:

* improving the indentification valuable team members with exceptional skills
* knowing concrete actions and reflection one can take to become a 10x programmer
* dispelling useless ideas that prevent you from seeing your situation with clearer eyes

## Genus

Let's begin by talking definitions.  A 10x programmer should be categorically consistent with other terminology.  What is the genus what is the differentia.  The is an important place to begin because analysis of the genus first leads us to the question, "what is a 10x programmer in reference to?".  There are many options:

* relative to the worst programmer in existence
* relative to the average programmer in existence
* relative to the entry level programmer within an organization
* relative to the average social perception of a programmer

We come first to the realization that 10x programmer really is an assignment of skill relative to another group, definitionally I think we should consider the genus the organization to which the programmer belongs to.  When talking about comparison of skills I think it's important to try to isolate as many variables as possible.  Defining the genus of a 10x programmer as "the organization the 10x programmer belongs to" helps us filter out non-essential comparisons.  When we talk about 10x programmers we're not comparing a person to:

* programmers fresh out of school
* programmers in entirely different industries or skill sets

If we constrain our genus to only the organization a programmer works with, we end up with an useless comparison to anywhere outside of our organization. Consider a company where there's only brilliant programmers, there would never be a 10x programmer, yet a very junior entry level programmer entering into the company would suddenly make many 10x programmers.  This isn't a useful definition.

To resolve this problem, we must recognize that 10x programmer, must refer to a specific context of a role.

* 10x *graphics* programmers
* 10x *intern* programmers
* 10x *web* programmers
* 10x *principle* programmer

Only compared to the role of a programmer as the genus does the terminology become useful.  An organization can suddenly identify many questions:

* do we have top tier talent for the roles of programmers we hire?
* are the interns we've hired of high quality?
* is our software engineer of such high performance they deserve a promotion?

These are the types of questions I believe the term 10x programmer was meant to answer.  People we've grasped to label as exceptional.

 ## Differentia

This brings us to our next question, in what objective ways is a 10x programmer different from their peers? Let's start firstly with eliminating possibilities.  

Firstly our differentia must be something of a long-standing quality.  When talking about the essentials of anything, we must describe the aspects that primarily account for the overall entity.  Random strikes of inspiration, luck, knowing one particular thing at the right moment in time should be totally eliminated.  We're talking about objective qualities of a programmer that are long standing aspects of who they are.

Even within these essential traits there are many ways in which a programmer can never be an order of magnitude greater than their peers:

Consider first typing speed.  A 10x programmer can never be differentiated by natural typing speed.  There are physical and cognitive limits to a programmers ability to type out code. Even if it were possible to augment with technology the speed of typing at 10x ( perhaps through the use of AI or autocompletion ), it is a useless metric that has nothing to do with code quality, if a quick typer types and deletes bad code multiple times their speed does nothing for them versus a programmer that writes the correct code the first time.

Consider also lines of code.  A 10x programmer is not necessarily disinguished by lines of code.  10x quantities of inappropriate abstractions for a simple requirement is not an advantage.  When we tryin to distinguish a programmer from their peers, meaningful architected lines of code should be what is of consideration. 

Consider other physical limits: such a cognitive memory, concious hours in a day, caffiene intake, number of meetings with colleagues.  These are dimensions which programmers can certainly have advantages in, but not 10x order of magnitude advantages.  

The viable candidates remaining concentrate on long-term mental/personal characteristics of the programmer's conciousness itself.  When integrating various advantages we see programmers have, we begin to see the commonality of increasing the utilization of a programmers physical time.  The leads us to a conclusion that 10x programmer is sufficiently distinguished by objective cognitive qualities that allow the individual to maximize the utilization of their time in an enduring stating way.

## Objective cognitive qualities of 10x Programmers

Below are my personal inductions of habits that meet that criteria from my observed experiences of the greatest programmers i've worked with:

Knowing one's objective purpose and loving it deeply.
- not destructive habits irrationally aligned

Knowing one's codebase and processes broadly to be maximally autonomous

Forming knowledge well

## Conclusion

In conclusion we've identified a useful and objective definition of 10x programmer:

> A programmer of a specific role who has acheived a 10x utilization of their time compared to their peers of a similar role via the acquisition long-term deep personal alignment with their work and effective knowledge building of their role's field.

With this definition we can identify the exceptional members of our organization.  These marveled people that enduringly accomplish great work can be taken down from a pedestal of mythological and seen as realistically heroic peer they are.  Their skills can inspire us with fuel to acheive our own greatness, and not live as a mystery lacking useful comparison or reflection.
